Follow Friday is a common practice
on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ "Twitter") where many people spend
friday posting things like \#FF
@[aplusk](http://twitter.com/aplusk "Ashton Kutcher")
@[guykawasaki](http://twitter.com/guykawasaki "Guy Kawasaki") …  This
practice is distracting at best and fails to accomplish the single
purpose it intends. Follow friday began as way to share lesser known
twitter users with your community. A great idea that quickly grew out of
control. I propose a better implementation that will not only accomplish
the original intent but will do so in a non-distrcting manner by
leveraging twitter lists. I propose that any individual that wants to
share their recent finds, favorite follows or other gems create a list
called “recommends”. Keep a handful of people on this list. Cycle them
out as often as you like. You can find mine
at[@spf13/recommends](http://twitter.com/spf13/recommends)

This is a substantial improvement over follow friday.

1. It doesn’t litter statuses with a list of random names every
Friday.
2. It stream lines the process of actually following those people. In
the current approach one would need to click through to every single
name in the list, often approaching dozens, and view their twitter page
to evaluate whether they were follow worthy. The new approach, groups
all of them on a single page and allows you to view a set of their
tweets, not just in a instant, but over time. From this single page/view
it’s much easier to follow individuals from there.
3. People will actually use it. I don’t know of anyone who has the time
to actually click through each of the thousands of names that are posted
every Friday. By grouping them and keeping it around everyday, not just
friday, people will actually use it.

Sometimes pictures speak louder than words.

Here’s the current approach. It expects us to click through each of
those names and evaluate them in a moment. Does anyone actually do this
anymore?

Rather than littering your status with a list of names, add them to your
“recommends” list. Interested parties can follow your list and not only
see the names, but actually what they are tweeting. If they find them
interesting then it’s easy to follow them from there.
