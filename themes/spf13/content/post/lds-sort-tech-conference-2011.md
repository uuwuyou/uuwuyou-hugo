Last week I had the opportunity to attend the LDS Church’s SORT tech
conference. Nearly 1200 people were in attendance. There were 23
concurrent tracks and I was able to present two presentations and be on
a panel with other NoSQL solutions including Cassandra, CouchDB, Neo4j,
Riak and MarkLogic. The panel went for 90 minutes the first half being
an 5 – 10 minute introduction of each technology and the second half
being a QA period. It concluded with the audience of about 250 voting in
realtime for their favorite technology. MongoDB won nicely with nearly
2x the votes of the next closest technology. We received a 6 foot tall
trophy. It was the biggest trophy I’ve ever received. MongoDB is the
yellow piece of the pie.

It was a really fun event to attend. I was overwhelmed with the interest
and excitement around MongoDB. The MongoDB talks were always standing
room only with over 70 people in the first session and over 100 people
in the second. The LDS church has some very interesting data challenges
including the worlds largest genealogy database with billions of
individuals and relationships and many more times that in documents and
records. There was a lot of interest in MongoDB and it was nice to see
the excitement around it.

Since the conference I’ve gotten lots of positive feedback from
participants via twitter and email.
