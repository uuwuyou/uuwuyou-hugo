Someone once said a goal is a dream until you write it down … in your
blog and tell the world about it.

In an effort to focus on blogging a bit more frequently I have decided
to start a blogathon beginning today. **I will write a post every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday for the next four weeks**. I think this
rate will permit me to continue to keep quality posts, while increasing
the frequency and consequently the quantity. As usual my posts can be
expected to be quite random, perhaps more so than ever. This is a major
undertaking for me as currently I have been posting about once a month
since I started this blog. The goal here is to embark on a blogging
journey and hopefully create some great content along the way.

The whole idea for this came from noticing that [Seth
Godin](http://www.sethgodin.com/ "Seth Godin") writes a daily blog. Seth
has great content and to produce quality content that often requires
true skill.. Of course that’s his day job and he writes one of the most
popular blogs on the web. I hope you will join me in the journey here
and pass along the good word.

It’s all starting with this post. Stay tuned for another great post on
Wednesday!
