If you don’t know Rands (real name [Michael
Lopp](http://www.randsinrepose.com/ "Rands")), you should. His blog is
full of excellent content from someone who successfully figured out how
to transition from managing bits to Managing Humans (also the title of his
first book). Whether you are a developer, a tech manager, or manage
something else, you’ll find value in his posts. I’ve been reading his
blog for years and it’s influenced my decisions greatly.

Here are some of my favorite posts.

[Taking Time to Think](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2005/08/30/taking_time_to_think.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pretty self explanatory from the title. Seems like without even realizing it
[I’ve baked it into my
day](http://spf13.com/post/the-most-productive-20-minutes-of-my-day).

[Signs of Art](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2005/09/30/signs_of_art.html)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rands explains why software isn’t just bits, bytes and logic.

[Don’t be a Prick](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2005/05/18/dont_be_a_prick.html)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The working title of Rand’s book on management and a solid piece of
advice.

[What to do When You’re Screwed](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/07/10/what_to_do_when_youre_screwed.html)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or what to do when you are promoted from developer to manager.

[1.0](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/04/20/10.html)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Rands post on shipping a 1.0 version of a product including all the
pitfalls and struggles that accompany it. If you’ve ever worked on a
team releasing a product weather you are a designer, CEO or developer,
this is a must read guide.
