The protection of your intellectual property, or any information that
you post to your blog, forum or website, can be a tricky subject. While
there are those unscrupulous few out there in the cyber world who will
purposely copy your words as their own, there are more people that are
simply ignorant of the laws, unaware that they are stealing when they
copy and reuse your musings. According to a criminal lawyer at an
Orlando based firm that we spoke to, there are steps that you can take
to make sure that your intellectual property is protected. Here’s what
you can do:


**1. Obfuscate Your Code**

To protect yourself against thieves, use software like Dotfuscator and
JavaScript Obfuscator. These types of software programs will obfuscate
your coding, making your content more difficult to steal by making a
program’s source code difficult to read by humans. When someone tries to
copy and paste your blog entry, they’ll be left with unreadable, useless
coding. Other helpful software includes vGuard, Jasob and Salamander
.NET Obfuscator.

**2. Post a Permissions Policy**

A page of your website or blog should be dedicated to an explicit
permissions policy. This policy will tell others what they can and can’t
do with the content that you have posted. The key to a great permissions
policy is clarity; people should know exactly what it is that they can
do without your permission and when they’ll need to contact you. Once
you’ve published your policy, you’ll have something to point to if
someone violates it.

**3. Contact the Violator**

If you find that your content has been used by someone else, the first
thing to do is to send a polite email to the violator. 99 times out of
100, the person who used your content has no idea that they’ve done
anything wrong. Kindly thank them for finding your content interesting
enough to use on their own site, point to your permissions policy, and
offer suggestions as to how the person can use your content legally.

**4. Demand Removal**

If you’ve found the one person with whom a polite email doesn’t work,
you’ll need to escalate your efforts. Sit down and draft an email
demanding that the offender remove your content from their site
immediately. While it’s still suggested that you remain tactful and
polite, you may want to be a bit more forceful. Direct the offender to
your permissions policy again, letting them know that they are violating
copyright laws by allowing your content to remain public on their page.

**5. Contact the Hosting Site**

If steps two and three haven’t worked with the violator, you’ll need to
contact their hosting site. Find a site online that will allow you to
search for the person’s domain registration and, once you do, send an
email to the hosting service. Let the hosting service know the steps you
have taken and that you are now requesting removal of the web site. The
powers-that-be at the hosting site will investigate your claim and, if
it is found to be with merit, will take the site down.

**6. Get Legal Help**

At the end of the day, your last bit of recourse may be found in hiring
an attorney. A criminal defense lawyer can go to bat for you, helping
you to have the offending content removed from cyberspace.

*If you find that someone has copied your content for their own blog, be
flattered; it means that they’ve found your content useful or relevant.
Remember that most people don’t understand that they are violating any
laws, and an email is often enough to get your content removed from the
offending website. If you follow the steps above, you’ll ensure that
your intellectual property remains yours.*
