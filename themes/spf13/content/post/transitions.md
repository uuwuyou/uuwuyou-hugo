I couldn’t be more excited to announce that I have accepted a position
at [The Open Sky Project](http://theopenskyproject.com). I am leading
the architecture, development and technology.

It’s rare in life that one has the opportunity to do what they love to
do and be paid to do it. Even rarer is to do something great with people
you love working with. At OpenSky I have found this and more. There is
an energy and excitement at OpenSky; come spend 10 minutes in our office
and you will feel it. The team is passionate about what they are doing
and the passion is growing.

OpenSky has assembled the strongest team I have ever seen at an early
stage startup. Each member of the management team has excelled in their
particular domain and exhibits youthful passion for doing it. This level
of deep experience allows us to focus on building the business, which is
hard enough without the distraction of trying to learn how to do your
job as well.

The more time I spend at OpenSky, the more impressed I am. There isn’t a
weak link in the chain, and when you combine this with a great idea,
good things are bound to happen. I couldn’t be more excited to be a part
of this team working together to build the next great e-commerce
revolution.

We are at a really good place right now. All startups begin with an
idea, turn it into an experiment, and if that goes well, build a
business around it. We are at the exciting stage where the experiment
was not only successful but exceeded all possible expectations. Now we
get to go full speed ahead building a great business and all the
technology and systems to power it.

We have the challenge and opportunity to build a modern scalable
e-commerce system using the best open source software, libraries and
technologies.

I am looking for the best and brightest to come and join our great team
of all star engineers. If you’re interested give me a shout out
on [twitter @spf13](http://twitter.com/spf13) or check out [our jobs
page](http://theopenskyproject.com/join).
