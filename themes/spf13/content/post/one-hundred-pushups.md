A while back a bunch of people were twittering about the 100 pushup
challenge. Thanksgiving was the catalyst for me. I began my quest for
better health about a week ago.

The premise of the challenge is quite simple. It is a six week program,
that if followed, you can do 100 consecutive good form push ups at the
end of the program. I am in decent enough shape now, despite not
visiting the gym as often as I should. During the initial test I erked
out 31 pushups. I knew there was another teir at 30, so that was my
goal. I have been tracking my progress
here [http://spf13.com/pushups](http://spf13.com/pushups)

I also convinced the entire Portero Tech team to join me in my quest, or
at least the start of it. Some of them are also tracking their
progress [http://justinhileman.info/pushups](http://justinhileman.info/pushups).
