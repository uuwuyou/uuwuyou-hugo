This isn’t new, [Louis C.K.](http://www.louisck.net/ "Louis C.K.")
ranted this on Conan’s show in 2008.. I came across it recently and felt
like sharing.

I don’t really know much about Louis C.K., this is really the first
thing I’ve seen of him, but I think he makes some excellent points.
Happiness is learning to appreciate what you have. We live in an amazing
time exceeding the dreams of our grandparents. How much happier would we
be if we simply realized that. Full clip after the break…
