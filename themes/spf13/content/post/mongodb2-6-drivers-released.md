Iâ€™m pleased to announce the coordinated release of drivers in 9
languages in preparation for the release of  MongoDB 2.6. This is the
largest driver release in the history of MongoDB, both in terms of code
changes as well as in terms of drivers released. Official Drivers for C,
C++, C# (.net), Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala were all
released with Perl following shortly. In the upcoming weeks community
drivers  will be updated to take advantage of the new features present
in MongoDB 2.6. With both community and official drivers MongoDB is
supported in over two dozen languages and platforms.

The new drivers support the following features:
