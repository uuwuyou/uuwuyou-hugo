It has been my privilege to be part of a few different open source
communities over the years. One of the things I appreciate most about
attending conferences is the opportunity to get to know the person behind
the code. As they present, or from individual conversations appreciation
deepens as face and their story emerges. In effort to replicate this
experience in a broader setting I am launching “Between Two Devs”.

“Between Two Devs” is a series of conversations from one open source
developer to another. These are the stories behind the code. The origins
behind the project. Who is responsible and what drives them. These
conversations will be captured in glorious hi definition text available to
all.
