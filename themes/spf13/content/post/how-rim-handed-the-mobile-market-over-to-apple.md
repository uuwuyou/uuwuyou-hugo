***Hint: It has nothing to do with touch screens.***

While [RIM](http://rim.com "Research In Motion") scrambles to create the
next greatest device, or their
“[iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone "iPhone 3G") killer” it needs to
recognize that it’s no longer about the device. RIM don’t you remember
that touchscreens aren’t new.. Palm had them back in the 90′s … before
you crushed them.

When RIM ruled the world
------------------------

RIM knows what it takes to dethrone the current market leader.
RIM accomplished just that crushing a powerful and established palm.
RIM was successful where palm wasn’t for two reasons.

1.  Blackberry provided remote email access.
2.  Enterprises saw Blackberry as the solution to Palm’s shortcomings.

Blackberry (hardware) offered a single capability that Palm couldn’t,
remote email, and that made all the difference. Even when Blackberry’s
didn’t have phone capability they dominated the market.

Today, when the iPhone rules the world\*
----------------------------------------

Today’s marketplace is vastly different. The hardware is all comparable.
There is no longer a single hardware driven feature that one vendor can
offer that the others can’t duplicate. In such an environment it will be
the software that differentiates one device from the next.

[Apple](http://www.apple.com "Apple") learned this lesson and is smart
enough not to repeat their failure to win the desktop war. They know
exactly why M\$ won the desktop war. It wasn’t because of a better OS,
it was because they had tons of 3rd party support. For those that
believe that the desktop war isn’t over, and Apple still has a chance,
your wrong. The desktop war ended years ago, when applications moved
from the desktop to the web. Now the next war has begun and Apple (and
[Google](http://google.com "Google")) have come to fight. The next war
is the phone war… are we still calling these things phones… seeing as
“phone” is such as small part of what they do. Mobile computing war
sounds a bit better.

Proof that the war is already strongly leaning towards Apple. I still
own a blackberry.. stupid Verizon contract. I sit in awe as my friends
and co-workers continually show me their newest app. I spent an hour
trying to install an application on my BlackBerry that would tell me
what the weather forecast was. I visited dozens of sites, read blogs,
googled a bunch just to find a single application that would work. On an
iPhone it is as simple as searching in the [app
store](http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/ "App Store") and clicking
install.

\*Apples Achilles Heel
----------------------

In a word. DRM. Which has opened the door for a strong competitor in
Google with their open [Android
platform](http://code.google.com/android/ "Android").
