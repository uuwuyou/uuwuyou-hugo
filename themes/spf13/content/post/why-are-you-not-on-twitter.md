Over the last 2 weeks I have found myself asking that question more
times than I can remember. When I first heard
about [microblogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging "Micro-blogging")—or
Twitter, the primary service that started the microblogging
movement—over a year ago I thought it was a stupid fad and wouldn’t
last. I mean what value can possibly be passed along in 140 characters
or less. 2 weeks ago I was convinced to
try [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/ "Twitter") and I am hooked.

Microblogging is a new medium for communication. It is part instant
message, but broadcasted, part forum, part blog. In short it takes a
bunch from a lot of existing methods
of [communicating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication "Communication")but
it is a medium of it’s own. Microblogging at the heart is really one
question: **“What are you doing?”**. While it would seem odd to email
or [IM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging_%26_messengers "Instant messaging & messengers")
your friends that you are sitting down to dinner, that is exactly
what [microblogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging "Micro-blogging")
is about. It provides connections and is a great [level playing
field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_playing_field "Level playing field")
which everyone is accessible to everyone.

10 reasons I use twitter
------------------------

1.  **Quick.** Writing a blog post takes a long time. This post is
    already pushing an hour, I can tweet (twitter in verb form) a good
    few hundred times in that span.
2.  **Painless.** Because tweeting only takes a few seconds, people
    actually do it, all the time, usually a few times a day.
3.  **Insightful.** It provides great insight and interaction with
    people who I admire and / or respect. I have learned quite a bit
    about developing a good startup culture by
    following[@zappos](http://twitter.com/zappos).
4.  **Real Time.** You can see life unravel **as it happens**. The day I
    started writing this post the new iPhone was released. There were
    thousands of tweets long before anyone blogged about their
    experiences. Those tweets showed the joys and frustrations of the
    new iPhone. [One twitterer](http://twitter.com/bobthecow) documented
    his 9 hour ordeal waiting in line at the Manhattan Apple Store while
    in line, as it was happening.
5.  **Popularity.** There are people
    on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/ "Twitter") who you want to
    connect with but haven’t yet been able to.
6.  **Networking.** On Twitter there aren’t any cold introductions.
    Because everything you post is visible and transparent, it is
    immediately apparent who you are, and you don’t need to spend time
    introducing yourself. It is a very good place to network and connect
    with new people.
7.  **Transparency.** It is very transparent and as a result organic.
    Because of this it is a very comfortable place to be.
8.  **Self promotion.** I think I am pretty smart about a few things. I
    twitter about those things and other’s see that I “get it”. What and
    how I tweet about things, the discussions and communication I have
    with others provides great insight to potential partners, employers,
    customers, investors etc into how I think about things and how I
    conduct myself.
9.  **Power of many.** No matter how smart I am about things someone is
    smarter, and a lot of them are on Twitter. Posting a question to
    Twitter usually results in many quick responses.
10. It feeds perfectly into my ADD life.

Microblogging Services
----------------------

I have mentioned Twitter heavily here, but there are over a dozen
similar services. Here are some of the more popular ones:

-   [Twitter](http://twitter.com) — The one that started it all. It
    still has the largest user base, despite frequent outages.
-   [Pownce](http://pownce.com) — [Digg](http://www.digg.com/ "Digg")
    founder, [Kevin Rose](http://kevinrose.com "Kevin Rose")‘s
    brainchild. Has more features than twitter, but none that matter.
-   [Jaiku](http://jaiku.com) — Google just purchased, so expect to be a
    player.<br>
    [http://plurk.com](http://plurk.com "http://plurk.com") – Focus on
    converstions, rather than broadcast messages.

Meta Microblogging Services
---------------------------

-   [Ping.fm](http://ping.fm) — Ping.fm is in closed beta. Comment on
    this post if you want an invite. Posts to just about any service out
    there. Also you can post from almost anywhere: email,
    IM, [SMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service "Short message service")or
    Facebook.
-   [Socialthing!](http://socialthing.com) — Aggregates posts from
    everywhere. Deduplicates for when people use tools like Ping.fm to
    crosspost.

Tools
-----

-   [TwitterFox](http://www.naan.net/trac/wiki/TwitterFox) — good
    Firefox extension.
-   [Twitterific](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific) — Mac
    only client many people swear by.
-   [Twhirl](http://www.twhirl.org/) — Cross-platform Adobe Air based
    Twitter client, similar to Twitterrific. Can connect to multiple
    accounts, cross-post to Pownce and Jaiku, and post images to
    TwitPic.
