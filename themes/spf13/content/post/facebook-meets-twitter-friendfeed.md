For the past few months [Facebook](http://facebook.com "Facebook") has
been obsessed with [Twitter](http://twitter.com/blog "Twitter"). It’s
easy to see why. Twitter is addicitve. Many twitter users are constantly
on twitter. Whenever you goto twitter there is always something new
happening. Facebook obviously wants this experience on facebook. Why not
copy twitter. I think Facebook could do it and do it better. Last week
Facebook unveiled their new home page layout. Inspite of critical
feedback. It is a vast improvement with lots of potential.

What’s Good
===========

Facebook is alive again. There is a deep sense of community and
freshness. Updates happen a lot less often that twitter, but that isn’t
necessarily a bad thing… and the new design is encouraging more frequent
posts and updates.

What’s Missing
==============

A lot of what’s missing is being addressed by Facebook. Here are two
critical features they haven’t addressed yet:

### 1. Stackable filters

The new design is built to be stacked. I want to see links from my
college group. In the current iteration of facebook, it’s one or the
other.

### 2. Create groups from search results.

As  soon as the new design was unveiled I set out to use it. I created a
group of all my highschool friends. Though it’s an easy list to find,
simply by using search, there is no way to take that search result and
create a group from it. Instead the only approach is to individually
select each of my 200+ friends from highschool. It was a time consuming
exercise I won’t repeat.

If Facebook can figure out the grouping properly it will solve the
current issue most users are disappointed by, as well as solving an
obvious flaw with the Twitter /
[FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com "FriendFeed") model.
