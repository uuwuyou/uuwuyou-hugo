No question about it, choosing a good hosting partner is one of the most
important decisions a CTO / CIO can make, especially in a .com company.
I recently had to choose a hosting partner for the
new [portero.com](http://portero.com). Since the space changes so
rapidly the last provider you used may no longer be the best fit for you
now. Here’s 10 criteria you need to evaluate when analyzing a hosting
partner.

## 1. Service Level Agreements

SLA’s are discussions of nines, 3 nines (99.9%), 4 nines, (99.99%), 5
nines (99.999%). How many nines is important, but more important is the
recourse when they fail to meet that level. No matter what hosting
company, at one point or another something will happen and they will be
down longer than the guaranteed uptime. What does it mean to you?

## 2. Availability

How accessible are they? When you are stuck with a challenging problem
do they have resources available to help? Do you have a dedicated
account manager? Are they overloaded with too many accounts so you can’t
receive the attention you need?

## 3. Security (PCI compliance / certification)

While the PCI standard has been developed by the credit card industry,
nearly all of the requirements are what would be considered best
practices. Even if your not running an ecommerce website you’re going to
want a host that takes security seriously and that means PCI
compliance.<br>

## 4. Failsafe (Redundancy)

What measures do they have in place for when failure occurs? There are X
different kinds of failures, Data, Hardware, Network, Power, Catrastophy
which can occur on small scale (your server) or large scale ( the entire
facility, city, state, etc). What services can they offer you to prevent
loss and downtime.

## 5. Scalability

How easy is it to add resources? Can they offer you the support and
infrastructure you’ll need when your site hits 100,000 members? How
about 1 million? 100 million?

## 6. Cost

Cost is an obvious factor. When comparing hosts it’s important to
compare apples to apples. Some hosts itemize every service, others
provide additional services included in the hosting package.

## 7. Support

The 3 am test is worthwhile here. Call the support line at 3am. How long
do you have to wait to speak to someone? How much longer do you have to
wait until you speak to a qualified tech?

Does the support staff seem knowledgeable. Do they have people on staff
that can help you with non standard requests? Which OS / Distribution do
they support?

## 8. Infrastructure?

Where is their facility located? How many Tier 1 pipelines are running
into it? What is the latency?

## 9. Reputation

Having a great marketing team and a great product aren’t all that common
for the same company. Don’t assume credibility because a given company
mentions “hosted by …”. They are getting premium service for this co-op
marketing.  Ignore the marketing, what are others really saying about
them? Real customers not partners or paid references.

## 10. Extra

Do they offer any value adds? Companies are doing a lot these days to
differentiate themselves, some of which is considerable. Are they
offering free offsite backup? Managing your servers?
