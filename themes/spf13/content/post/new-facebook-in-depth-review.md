Facebook just unveiled their biggest change yet.
TheÂ [http://www.new.facebook.com](http://www.new.facebook.com "http://www.new.facebook.com")
website is a preview of the next design of Facebook. The new design
places more emphasis on friends and actions and downplays the
applications. There is a lot more than just design going on. They also
reveal some new functionality. I will present an in-depth review of what
to expect from Facebook complete with screenshots.

New Profile Screen
==================

The new profile screen is where the meat of the changes are. First of
all the new layout is a welcome change. Noticibly missing are the
excessive applications that were turning Facebook into myspace (and that
is a bad thing). It is very ajax driven and most actions happen without
leaving the page.

Info Tab
--------

The info tab retains the sidebar and looks similar to the current
version, except with increased usability as you can now edit on the same
screen.

Photo Tab
---------

The photo tab is much more prominent that photos were previously on
Facebook. This is a sign that Facebook is finally getting it that media
is important.

Boxes Tab
---------

The applications for the most part have been hidden in the Boxes tab.

More Profile Functionality
--------------------------

The profile is very web 2.0 and ajaxy, or whatever term you want to use.
It is responsive and intuitive. Try to upload a photo or video on
Facebook currently. It is easily the most overly confusing process on
the site. The new Facebook completely fixes this by placing actions
right on the profile page.

Additionally Facebook now provides filters for your news feed.

Applications Menu
=================

In the new version Facebook made a good choice in having the new
applications menu appear in the new top nav, and pop out instead of
occupying valuable real estate. It appears that not all applications
will just work with the new Facebook, but the Facebook created ones are
already ported over.

The New Friends Screen
======================

Little has changed here. A screenshot just for proof. In all honesty
though, this was the one thing Facebook already did an impressive job
with.
