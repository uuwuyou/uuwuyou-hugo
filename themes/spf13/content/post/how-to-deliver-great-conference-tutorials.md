I recently returned from [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010 "OSCON")
where I was able to give one of the more popular presentations at the
conference. I presented on the morning of the first day and throughout
the entire week people kept coming up to me telling me how much they
enjoyed my tutorial and how bored they were at the sessions they
attended since. Here are the secrets of how I gave such a compelling
[presentation](http://spf13.com/post/how-i-gave-the-most-viewed-presentation-in-the-history-of-oscon/ "How I gave the most viewed presentation in the history of OSCON").

To setup [the
tutorial](http://spf13.com/post/how-i-gave-the-most-viewed-presentation-in-the-history-of-oscon/ "How I gave the most viewed presentation in the history of OSCON")
a bit more, the objective was for 150 people to write their [first
MongoDB
app](http://spf13.com/post/building-your-first-mongodb-app-oscon-2012/ "Building your first MongoDB app – OSCON 2012").
I had three hours to introduce them to
[MongoDB](http://spf13.com/post/building-your-first-mongodb-app-oscon-2012/ "Building your first MongoDB app – OSCON 2012"),
write and deploy the code. Three hours isn’t a lot of time and 150
people is a very large group to get to accomplish something in unison.
This was even further complicated by the fact that this was an open
source conference with attendees having varying experience all in
different languages, this posed quite the challenge.

Secret 1. Don’t expect 100% attendee completion
-----------------------------------------------

Does that objective sound impossible. It should, it is. There was
absolutely no way to accomplish that. I decided that rather than ignore
this and proceed in a hopeless fashion to embrace the challenge and
assume from the get go that not everyone would be able to finish. It’s
not like this is a college class where everyone has taken the
prerequisites and is prepared, people are attending from all different
walks of life and situations.

Secret 2. Play to the averages
------------------------------

I quickly realized while giving the tutorial that some people would
finish much faster than others. Rather than bore the fast people at the
expense of the slower people I decided to play the averages. I told the
audience that we would move on when about half the attendees were ready
to. That also meant that half weren’t so I put the slides up online so
that they could follow along at their own pace. This had a dramatic
effect on the audience. While I was worried having some people trailing
behind might hinder the overall engagement, it turned out to
significantly increase as the most engaged people were the faster half
and they remained engaged through the entire presentation. Through the
next four days of the conference people kept coming up to me thanking
them for doing this citing how bored they were at other sessions they
attended which catered to the slower half.

Secret 3. Involve the audience
------------------------------

I could have lectured the entire time, but 3 hours is a LONG time to
fill and regardless of how entertaining a speaker is, it’s very easy to
lose focus over that length of time. While I did lecture some of the
time, I interleaved it with asking the audience to teach as well. I
would put up a slide with the next block of code and ask them to point
out what was interesting or notable about it. With few exceptions they
made all the points I tried to make. It allowed the audience to
participate and share in the learning and instructing process. Rather
than me being the know at all in front, we learned together.

The audience agreed and many tweeted about it.

Secret 4. Have fun with it
--------------------------

People aren’t signing up for a in person tutorial to learn. If all they
wanted to do was learn, for a lot less money they could buy a book and
follow along. They attend conferences to be entertained and participate
in a community of similar people. Fulfill that want. Liven up the
presentation with humor. Be professional, but don’t take yourself to
seriously. Smile and look like you are enjoying yourself. If you give
off the aura that you are having a good time, the attendees will too.

This presentation had a lot of significant challenges. Using the above
secrets I was able to not only deliver a great presentation but it took
on a second life online and became the \#1 most viewed presentation in
the history of OSCON (according to slideshare) with over 30k views.
