I’ve decided to expand the scope of this site a bit to be more than just
a blog. It makes sense, many of my posts are how tos and often for my
own projects. Additionally now each project will have a legitimate
project “homepage” for things like [GitHub](http://github.com/spf13)
where that’s requested.

So without further ado… Please checkout my
[Projects](http://spf13.com/projects "Projects") and
[Presentations](http://spf13.com/presentations "Presentations") sections
of my website [spf13.com](http://spf13.com).

For now most of the projects are centered around
[VIM](http://spf13.com/project/spf13-vim "spf13-vim : A better Vim Distribution")
and [PHP](http://spf13.com/project/piv "PIV : PHP Integration for VIM")
and the Presentations around
[Ecommerce](http://spf13.com/post/mongodb-ecommerce-a-perfect-combination "MongoDB & Ecommerce : A Perfect Combination")
and
[MongoDB](http://spf13.com/post/augmenting-rdbms-with-nosql-for-e-commerce "Augmenting RDBMS with NoSQL for e-commerce").
This is certain to change in the upcoming weeks, especially as I have
more time to create more project pages.
