While it may not seem intuitive taking time out to selflessly help
others will help you more than them. This week I haven’t had much time
to blog largely because this week many opportunities arose to help
others and I took them. Some at work, some outside of work. Helping
others will endear them to you. Not only will you ultimately benefit
more than what you’ve invested in helping others, but you will also make
a real difference in the lives of those whom you work with.

Here are for keys to helping others and making them feel like a priority
while doing so.

**1. Be empathetic.** Stop thinking of yourself and put yourself in the
shoes of those around you.

**2. Take time out**. Believe it or not, you have the time. Help others
and you will find more time to finish the things you need. Importantly
make whoever you are helping feel like they are the priority.

**3. Be genuinely interested.** Don’t only make the people you serve
feel like you are interested in them, be interested in them.

**4. Listen.** Nothing can make a person feel lower than to think
you don’t care about them, the easiest way to do this is to not listen
to them. If you value them (which you should), then show them you care
by listening to them.

Remember as the old adage says, it’s nice to be important, but it’s more
important to be nice
