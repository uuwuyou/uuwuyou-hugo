I came across an article today titled “[Help! My boss is on
twitter](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/nov/11/rules-if-boss-follows-you-on-twitter-etiquette)“.
Allow me to share a secret with you, if you current boss isn’t on
twitter yet, I can guarantee that your next one will be. Social media
has caught on like wildfire. In all the excitement too often people
forget that everything that you say on twitter / facebook and others is
being published and recorded. This isn’t a private conversation you are
having. Just because it’s not at the top of your feed doesn’t mean that
it’s not there.

Even if your current employer isn’t savvy to social media yet, your
next employer will more than likely due some due diligence (as simple as
a google search) and will be hiring or not hiring based on what he/she
finds. You can tell more about an individual from their tweets than a
job interview. Even if you nail an interview (assuming you get that far)
a few misguided tweets could blow it for you. Here’s some general good
advice.

### 1. Nobody want’s to hire someone that has a bad attitude.

It negatively affects everyone and lowers productivity faster than you
could imagine. If you are complaining, especially about your job, boss,
position, etc in your tweets (in a very public way) imagine how much
more damage you are doing in private.

### 2. Loose lips shink ships.

If your the type of person that is isn’t smart enough to keep private
matters private, why would anyone trust you with any information or
responsibilities.

### 3. An image is worth 1000 words.

Be especially careful about what images you post. Your appearance and
conduct can say a lot about who you are and nothing reveals that better
than a photo or video.
