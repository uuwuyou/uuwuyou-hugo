With Google launching their [chrome
book](http://www.google.com/chrome "Google Chrome") is significant as it
reflects a substantial shift in the world of computing. For the first
time ever, the [application
platform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform "Computing platform")
isn’t the operating system, nor is it adobe air, .net or java, it’s the
browser. The browser once, a simple tool for fetching and rendering
content is now the most important **application** platform in the world.

Ultimately the reason we are converging on the browser being the
platform is because java failed. If java came any bit close to it’s
promised mission, the underlying operating system wouldn’t matter and
every application would be written in java.

It missed completely and in the hole it left the browser became the
platform.

Wanna write a application that works on everything from Mac, windows,
Linux, beos, iOS, android, webos, etc; write it for the browser.

Ironically the universal programming language will be JavaScript not
Java. Javascript’s code integrated with, and embedded in, HTML, not Java
applets distinct from HTML.

This is why HTML 5 is so important. It will actually let us developed
advance applications for the browser.
