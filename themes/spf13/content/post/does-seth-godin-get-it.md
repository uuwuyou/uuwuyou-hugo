Earlier this week [Seth Godin](http://www.sethgodin.com/ "Seth Godin")
announced his first presence on twitter with the post [Delivering blogs
via
Twitter](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/11/delivering-blogs-via-twitter.html)..

Perhaps you missed the revelation. Seth Godin believes that he cannot
focus on authoring a blog and books while participating on twitter. This
begs the question if Seth Godin can’t do it, is it possible? Clearly
very successful productive people are on twitter and seem to manage it
just fine, so we cannot believe that it is impossible for anyone, just
for Seth.

From this statement we can derive one of two conclusions:

### 1. Seth Godin doesn’t understand twitter

One of the wonderful things about tweeting is that it really doesn’t
take any additional time, but rather it fills existing voids. Not every
tweet needs to be some amazing revelation requiring strategic thought.
People are interested in what other people are doing and thinking.
Twitter is built on spontanity. This is especially true for famous /
successful people perhaps because we believe that we may learn what
makes them so popular / successful.

### 2. Seth Godin really understands twitter

The truth is that twitter is not a broadcast platform, but rather an
interactive conversation held across a very loosely connected community.
To participate is to spend time and to give of yourself. People that
really “get” twitter claim to spend hours a day on twitter fostering
that community. Since this is Seth Godin’s field, if he was on twitter,
he would really need to be on twitter, a fully vested time commitment.

The compromise is of course to extend his blog to twitter without
actually committing to be a part of the community. Is this the best use
of twitter, probably not, but that’s the point, he’s not on twitter.
