Every so often a “new” technology catches on. Right now it’s nosql
databases. A couple years ago it was Ruby, before that it was java. Each
arise because they propose a solution to an existing problem, or in
other words a better way of doing something.. something, but not
everything.

Unfortunately knowing when to use the technology requires actual
experience with it, which never seems to catch up to the hype engine
quickly enough, so consequently the technology transforms into a “golden
hammer”. Better at everything and ready to displace everything that
existed before. Of course this nearly never happens because it’s not
rarely true. Current technologies exist because they do something well.
when a new technology emerges it will likely be good at a different
thing meaning the two will co-exist.

The second stage of the hype factory is when it spills into the business
world. Last week I had a VC ask me if we were
using [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/ "Hadoop"). DId he really care
if we were using Hadoop? Of course not. He didn’t know enough about our
needs or architecture to even know if Hadoop would be appropriate. He
just knows that Hadoop is an emerging technology that a bunch of people
are talking about. Really what he wanted to know was are we keeping up
with the latest technologies.

The current situation is due the popularity of the LAMP stack
which is a victim of it’s own success. While Linux is virtually
universal in application today,
Apache, [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com "MySQL")
and [PHP](http://www.php.net/ "PHP") each have their own niches. The
LAMP became so easy to use together that people began to use MySQL for
things that [relational
databases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database "Relational database")
aren’t good at and are unnecessary
for. [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL "NoSQL") isn’t remotely
new technology, though until recently open source implementations either
didn’t exist or went unnoticed.

As [Facebook](http://facebook.com "Facebook"), Twitter and others saw
them as solutions to their massive scalability solutions (and because
they were using relational databases for things they shouldn’t have)
people began to see NoSQL as a golden hammer, big enough to solve
Facebook’s problems.NoSQL is a good solution to the right problem,
though unfortunately the gain in popularity now largely exists because
well intentioned, though seriously misinformed people believe it’s the
next golden hammer.
