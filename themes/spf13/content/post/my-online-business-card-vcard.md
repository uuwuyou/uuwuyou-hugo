I wanted to polish up my javascript coding so I decided that the best
way to do that was with a project that I’ve been wanted to do for a
while anyway, my own identity site, or my online business card, or my
online vcard. The idea was inspired by [Tim Van
Damme](http://timvandamme.com/ "Tim Van Damme")’s website.

To accomplish this I wrote a jquery plugin to handle the navigation,
animation etc.. The site itself is rather simple, a single html page and
a few images. The markup is written in such a way that it works
perfectly (minus the hiding and animation) even when javascript isn’t
present.

I’ll write a separate post on how I wrote the jquery plugin and would be
happy if anyone else could use it. I just ask that if used that people
provide proper attribution both in the code and with a link back
to [stevefrancia.com](http://stevefrancia.com).

Please enjoy my new site and feel free to provide suggestions in the
comments below or via the[contact form](http://spf13.com/contact).
