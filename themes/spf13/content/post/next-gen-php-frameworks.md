With the release of PHP 5.3, PHP released the most significant
capabilities in years. Specifically the addition of Late Static
Bindings, Lambda Functions and Closures, and Namespaces has changed
everything. These new features open new doors for solutions previously
impossible. As a result in recent months there has been a flood of new
frameworks and libraries taking advantage of these new features.
Effectively we are approaching the third wave of PHP frameworks.

The first wave included [Seagull](http://www.seagullproject.org/)
and [Zoop Frameworks](http://zoopframework.com) back before frameworks
became a buzz word.

The second wave followed the massive buzz factory [Ruby on
Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
generated. [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/),[Symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/), [Zend](http://framework.zend.com/)
and a slew of others followed. These frameworks were developed after PHP
5 became standard and took advantage of the new OO features provided.

This third wave is largely due to the release of [PHP
5.3](http://php.net/releases/5_3_0.php) and all the new languages
features and structures that accompanied it.

The space is really heating up. Here’s what’s happening…

**Zend Framework** [just
announced](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/Zend+Framework+2.0+Roadmap)
a fork for ZF 2.0 strictly 5.3 and above.

The [former lead developer](http://twitter.com/nateabele) of **Cake
PHP** has started a new framework for 5.3 and above
called[**Lithium**](http://lithify.me/).

[**Doctrine 2.0**](http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/2_0/en)
is in the works and is 5.3+. It is a significant upgrade from the 1.0
branch and takes advantage of the features provided in PHP 5.3.

[**Zoop
Framework**](http://zoopframework.com/blogs/justin/a-look-at-whats-coming-in-zoop-framework-20)
has a stable but not feature complete 2.0 branch which is 5.3 and above.

[**Symfony**](http://symfony-reloaded.org/) just announced their 2.0
alpha release which you guessed it, only runs on 5.3 and above.

[**Fat-Free Framework**](http://fatfree.sourceforge.net/) is a brand new
framework which, as the name indicates, is very VERY light. It is
further along in development than all the other frameworks listed (read
stable), but also far less ambitious in scope. If you are developing a
small application FFF would be a solid choice, though I have doubts that
without a lot of external development it would make sense for a large
application.

While all these frameworks/libraries are rather early in their
development process, many are quite usable and show really smart design.
It’s great that the community has embraced this and is willing to
re-engineer existing solutions to utilize the benefits of PHP 5.3.
