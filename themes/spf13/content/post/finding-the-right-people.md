Since I began at Open Sky a few weeks ago I have been tasked with
building out a great team. Over the course of my career I have
interviewed hundreds of people (mostly developers) and hired dozens. At
OpenSky I was able to find and hire 6 fantastic employees in my first 6
weeks and wanted to share some of the tips and techniques I have learned
over the years and found successful.

Make connections
----------------

Most of my best hires came through referrals. Get out and network with
people in the community and the space your needs are. There are so many
tools available today to do this
including[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com "LinkedIn")
and [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter"). These tools are not to
replace personal connections, but to assist in making and keeping them.
There really isn’t any excuse for not having a solid and reliable
network.

Interview well
--------------

The whole purpose of an interview is to determine if the candidate is a
good fit for your company and a good fit for the given role. Also it’s
important to ensure that your company is a good fit for them. Something
they will be passionate about and will help their career. I usually know
within the first 10 minutes if the candidate is the right fit.. If not
I’ll let them know why and end the interview right there. There are many
good different approaches to interviewing. Figure out what works for
you.

Don’t compromise
----------------

If the candidate isn’t the right person, don’t hire them. The right
person is out there. Ever time I have compromised I have regretted it.
Only bad results have come from it. Nobody is better than the wrong
body.

Hire well and fire better
-------------------------

Success comes from having the right person in the right job. The
interview process is supposed to determine this, but even the best
interviewers aren’t perfect. If the candidate isn’t the right fit move
on quickly. The right candidate is out there, go out and find them. The
damage the wrong employee has an organization is huge. Help them find
the right opportunity where they can be the most successful.
