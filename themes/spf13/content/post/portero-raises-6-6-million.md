I am happy to announce that [Portero](http://www.portero.com/) has
raised $6.6 million in funding. The round was led by [LFE
Capital](http://www.lfecapital.com/ "LFE Capital") joined by returning
backers including Grosvenor
Funds. [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/portero-raises-66-million-round-for-online-luxury-goods-marketplace/)
picked up the announcement early this morning and featured us on their
home page. As I have a bit of an insiders view, I felt it was my place
to provide a bit of insight into why Portero is such a great company.

Portero is the Leading Authentic Luxury Marketplace providing a trusted
place for consumers to find and buy luxury items. Portero accomplishes
this by operating a fast growth market platform that facilitates sales
of luxury items by offering individuals, dealers, vendors and brands a
unified selling platform that ***maintains brand and item integrity***
and the ***assurance of authenticity***.  Items on Portero.com include
pre-owned (often in original packaging) and vintage. ***All are
certified and guaranteed authentic*** with a focus on watches,
accessories, handbags, jewelry and art.

Portero’s Value
---------------

-   Assurance that all items are authentic in a world of fraud,
    counterfeit or fake,  trust, credibility is important.
-   Consolidating a disparate market into one place to easily explore a
    wide set of goods.
-   Providing a place where one can sell goods in a environment that
    holds the integrity (value) of the branded luxury item.  Consumers,
    vendors and brands.
