Recently a book came out [The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs: How to
be Insanely Great in Front of Any
Audience](http://carminegallo.com/stevejobsbook/). Jobs has mastered the
art of presenting. I thought it would be interesting to look at his
presentations over the years. Here are the three biggest
announcements [Apple](http://www.apple.com "Apple") has
made.. [iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/ "IMac") (Jobs first product
after
returning),[iPod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod "IPod"), [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone "iPhone").

Look at how his personal style has changed over the years. As time
progress he began to emulate his products more. His appearance is much
simpler and more refined. Look at how his presentation style has
changed over the years. In his iMac presentation, Steve gives us a well
presented, but somewhat canned and tech heavy product pitch. Notice how
the word count on the slides dramatically decreases over time. The
presentations become more about the image and visual storytelling,
rather than the details. When we reach the iPhone announcement he is full
on storytelling. His story has villains, peril and a hero (Apple, and by
extension, Steve Jobs himself).
