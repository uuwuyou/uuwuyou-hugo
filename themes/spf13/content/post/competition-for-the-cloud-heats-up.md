Cloud no longer a single vendor game. For years cloud computing has been
synonymous with Amazon whose [Amazon Web
Services](http://aws.amazon.com/ "Amazon Web Services") really created
and defined the space. In the past year other providers have matured and
in some areas even surpassing Amazon.

In a conversation with Scott White, the VP of Sales from
[Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com "Rackspace"), he related to me
their approach on the cloud and how customers are utilizing their cloud
offering. Their current growth rate is pretty staggering. It’s a
magnitude higher than their managed hosting offering. Rackspace somewhat
trepidatiously entered the cloud market. It did so with Mosso, a subsidy
of Rackspace that operated for two years under a separate brand,
seemingly to distance the initiative from the Rackspace name in the
event it was a failure. It succeeded and has been rebranded as the
Rackspace Cloud. What is interesting about this offering is, in part
thanks to their background and existing infrastructure, they provide
hybrid computing offerings. Where all on the same subnet you can have
some nodes utilizing their traditional managed hosting offering where
other nodes are in the cloud elastically growing to meet demand.

The lack of cloud computing standards has lead to a vendor-lock. Every
cloud vendor has proprietary cloud. OpenServer is the bold initiative by
Rackspace to change that. Rackspace has always been about service as
their competitive advantage. Figuring they (and everyone else) couldn’t
compete with the lead amazon has, they turned the tables by open
sourcing their technology and defining standards along with a group of
other cloud providers to form OpenServer.

Also entering the field are many of the tech giants
including [HP](http://www.hp.com/go/instant-on), who has really invested
in their cloud offering with their Instant On service.
[VMware](http://www.vmware.com/ "VMware") bringing their decades of
virtualization experience to their offering.
[IBM](http://www.ibm.com "IBM") is all in, competing on the Paas, SaaS
and IaaS fronts. Rounding out the compelling offerings are
[GoGrid](http://www.GoGrid.com "GoGrid"), [Cloud.com](http://cloud.com)
and [Joyent](http://joyent.com).

While not Cloud in the Amazon sense, Microsoft and Google are both
providing cloud like services. Microsoft is in the ring with Azure,
their Windows Platform as a service offering. Google offers Google Apps
and [AppEngine](http://code.google.com/appengine/ "Google App Engine")
as offerings in the SaaS and PaaS markets.
