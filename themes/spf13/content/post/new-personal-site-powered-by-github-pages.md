At 10gen we had new headshots taken recently. I think mine came out
great. I took this opporitunity to play with GitHub pages and update
[http://stevefrancia.com](http://stevefrancia.com). You should goto
[http://stevefrancia.com](http://stevefrancia.com) and checkout my new
personal page. If you like it, fork it. The entire page is
here [https://github.com/spf13/spf13.github.com](https://github.com/spf13/spf13.github.com),
it being
a derivative of [https://github.com/weightshift/The-Personal-Page](https://github.com/weightshift/The-Personal-Page).
