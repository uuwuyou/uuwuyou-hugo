As social media continues to emerge, many professionals are curious on
what is the best way to manage these various networks. For posting
updates I have found [ping.fm](http://ping.fm "Ping.fm") an invaluable
resource. I use it to manage updates across all my networks
including [Twitter](http://twitter.com/spf13 "Twitter"), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/steve.francia "Facebook"),[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/stevefrancia "LinkedIn"),
Flicker, [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/stevefrancia "FriendFeed")
and more. Here’s the skinny on how I utilize this resource.

If you’re not familar with ping.fm it enables one to post updates to one
or many different websites though email, web, IM, SMS and widgets.
Ping.fm also supports images so they can be sent via any of those
methods that support images. One of my favorite features of Ping.fm is
it’s ability to cross post or selectively post to groups. It does this
in an elegant manner through using groups. To send an update to a group,
all one needs to do is prepend my update with a \#groupname and it will
only update those groups.

Examples
--------

I don’t necessarily want every single update to go to all locations, but
frequently want an update to goto more than one location.  For instance…

This Update…

### Just ordered 25 4×6 prints for 25. Great deals every day this week… check it out [http://ping.fm/my1kd](http://ping.fm/my1kd)

Is perfect for the \#tweet group. I’d love to share it with everyone on
my network. However it isn’t really appropriate for LinkedIn as it’s
clearly not something I’m working on.

and this update…

### [http://ping.fm/p/SreAj](http://ping.fm/p/SreAj) – Taking the team out to shake shack. If were going to have a multi hour meeting we might as well have it in a park with good food.

Is appropriate for my \#all group. I’ll throw this on linkedIn as well
as twitter and facebook.

Some of my more personal updates I’ll reserve only for facebook.
