Not surprisingly, given my semi random content, I arrive at my posts a
few different ways.

### 1. I better write this down or I’ll never remember it

These posts are the result of a rather frustrating night of problem
solving. After reading tons of documentation and googling around,
reading forums and discussing on IRC I finally got it working. Now I
better write it down so I know how to do it next time.

### 2. I read something

I either read something that I very much agreed with or very much
disagreed with or that interested me enough to go on an ADD journey that
took me to the post I eventually wrote.

### 3. I had a spontaneous epiphany (is there any other kind?)

These usually are typed out as fast as possible and then I go back in a
day or two later. They often require more refinement than a normal post,
but the point is just to capture as much as I was thinking at the
moment.

Often I’ll think of a topic and say.. “hey I should blog that”. I have a
list in [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/ "Evernote") I maintain for
this specific purpose.

### My Approach

When It actually comes down to writing the post my typical approach is
to open [VIM](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim") or Pages and type
it out as fast as possible until I become stuck. My rough draft is
usually pretty good the first time through. I usually wait a day or two
and then go back and read it again fixing any issues along the way. 
I try to keep my posts to a page or so, anything longer I’ll usually
break up into a couple.

On my site I have a separation of features and posts or articles. Often
\#1 style posts become a feature. They are less about a given idea or
thought, and usually how to do something. Also they are somewhat
timeless unlike articles which are often a reaction to something either
in my life or in the world. Lastly I update features. One of my most
popular features is [how to customize
vim](http://spf13.com/content/my-custom-vimrc-file-vim) (a text editor)
of which I frequently update as my usage evolves.
