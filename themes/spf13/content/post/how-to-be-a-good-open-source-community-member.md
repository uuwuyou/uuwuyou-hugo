A friend of mine who is a very talented writer recently became
intrigued with open source and asked me to help her to understand how to
be a good open source community member. 

Open source is one of the most unusual things in the world. Is there any other
profession where highly skilled professionals donate their free time to give
their work away for free? Many spend long hours at their day
jobs, just to spend their nights and weekends doing the same thing.

I’ve been involved in open source for nearly 20 years -- I’ve started some of my
own successful community based projects ([Hugo](http://gohugo.io),
[spf13-vim](http://vim.spf13.com), [Cobra](http://github.com/spf13/cobra),
[Viper](http://github.com/spf13/viper), Zoop), contributed to many others and
been responsible for leading some of the most popular commercial open source
projects in history ([Docker](http://docker.com) & [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org)).

Over the years I’ve learned 3 rules that, when followed, are sure to make you a
good open source citizen.

# Rule 1. Assume good will

Not only is this a good rule for open source, but it’s also a good rule for life.
A lot of open source communication is done online in written formats.
Community members come from all over the world and from very different
cultures, so while most open source work is done in English,
it’s often not a community member’s first language. Far too often I’ve seen
these differences can lead to barriers and discord in the community when people
assume that others are operating with malicious intent. While it’s true
that there are some mean people out there, I have found that it’s always
best to assume that people mean well until they prove otherwise.


# Rule 2. Attitude of appreciation

Open source is built on on the backs of willing volunteers. Many people
want to help out and contribute their time and talents to the best of
their abilities. Far too often maintainers of projects have the attitude
of “you’re not good enough”. I’ve even seen projects reject great contributions
because of a spelling mistake in a comment. If you want to foster a
healthy community (or participate in one), you need to cultivate an attitude of
appreciation. This attitude manifests in different ways. 

With all of my open source projects, as at the Docker project, we’ve
adopted a policy of never saying “no”, but instead using contributor
errors as opportunities to teach our community members how to make it a
“yes”. Sometimes this works by showing them how to write better code,
tests, or documentation. Sometimes it’s teaching them a valuable skill.
This policy is generally helpful for the project overall, as once
someone is taught they often have a desire to return the favor and pay
it forward by helping other, less experienced members. 

Another way appreciation is manifested is by accepting contributions
even when they aren’t quite right. Oftentimes someone has taken a lot of
time to contribute to a project, perhaps your project, and they didn’t
get absolutely everything right along the way. Perhaps the documentation
isn’t quite up to snuff, or the test coverage could be better. Remember
that not everyone comes from the same background -- if English isn’t
their first language they may be embarrassed or unable to produce the
quality documentation you need. In these cases, I’ve found it’s best to
appreciate what they’ve done, take what they contributed, and carry it
the rest of the way for them. Some people worry that contributors will
be offended if you add to their contribution, but in my experience
they’ve always been very appreciative.

Lastly, one of the most important ways to show an attitude of
appreciation is to be responsive and thoughtful to questions, and
especially contributions, that people provide. If you aren’t able to do
this yourself, perhaps it’s time to ask for help. You’ll find great
community members who are happy to support.

# Rule 3. Don't be afraid to jump in... ask questions, contribute.

Open source is made up of volunteers. Volunteers who don’t wait for an
invitation to jump in and try to contribute. One of the best things you
can do is ask “what can I do to help?”. I promise that most open source
communities will not only provide many opportunities, but also the
support you need to be successful.

Many people are afraid that their work will be rejected if they submit
it, and this fear prevents them from contributing. I guarantee that two
things will happen as you contribute to open source: 1) some of your
work will be rejected, and 2) you will learn far more from these rejections
than any other way. I speak not only from personal experience, but from
conversations with many friends who are active contributors. To ensure
that your contribution has the best chance of being accepted, discuss it
with the project maintainers beforehand, during and after. They will be
very open to helping.
