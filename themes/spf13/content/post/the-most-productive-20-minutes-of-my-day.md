As part of my new years resolution to get in shape and spend less dough
I decided that I’d be better of walking from Grand Central to my office
on 18th St. I save ~$5 a day not taking the subway and get all the
extra benefit of walking the 1.5 miles.

A few days into this something wonderful and unexpected happened.
Instead of spending 20 minutes riding in a cattle car, I was able to
take 25 minutes where I was able to think about everything I had to do
for the day. It gave me time to prepare, plan, review and reflect. I’ve
gained more in productivity than I though possible simply by taking a
good amount of time to be alone with my thoughts. I’ve solved problems,
came to conclusions and had sudden epiphanies much quicker thanks to
this dedicated time to think.

It’s one new years resolution I’m certain I won’t have trouble sticking
with.
