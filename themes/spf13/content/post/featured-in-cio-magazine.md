I don’t know what could be more shocking that opening this month’s
edition of CIO magazine and discovering that my blog, this very blog
that you are currently reading is one of two blogs featured this month.
I am humbled and honored to be mentioned and included with such great
peers. To all my new readers I look forward to connecting with you
via [Twitter](http://spf13.com/twitter)
or [LinkedIn](http://spf13.com/linkedin). Check
out [cio.com](http://www.cio.com/) for more great content.
