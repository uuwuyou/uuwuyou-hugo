In 2007, [All Things
Digital](http://allthingsd.com/ "All Things Digital") held a fascinating
interview with both [Bill
Gates](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/default.mspx "Bill Gates")
and [Steve
Jobs](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/steve-jobs "Steve Jobs").

The interview runs long and is spread out over multiple clips. I’ve only
included the first handful here. Watch the rest on youtube.

It’s clear that they have a reasonably good relationship and clearly
know each other well. They have a genuine and sincere respect for each
other. It’s amazing how firm a grasp both have on the industry as a
whole. Steve is clearly passionate about the engineering aspects of his
business, while Bill is full geek about the coding and operates very
much in a shrewd business mentality.

Clip 3 contains some jabs at each other.. where else, but on the desktop
/ os space.

In clip 5 they both are on the same page taking a single stance.. which
now 2 years later is obviously
against [Google](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google "Google").
