Social media will be the next innovation in the most unlikely of places,
search ( leveraging the community to scale infinitely ). It’s not that
people will all together stop searching, but the approach that they take
to finding information will become increasingly social (rather than
algorithmic) in nature.

For the last decade, search always seems on the cusp of “intelligent”
results. Each new engine promises to be able to overcome “search
overload” as Microsoft puts is. Yet none have been able to actualize
this goal. If you want to know the best place in NYC to get pizza, you
don’t [ask
google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=best+pizza+in+nyc). Why,
because google will give you hundreds of results, without any acutal
value attached to them. You will certainly find better responses by
inquiring through social media.

Social media closely models information obtained the old fashioned way
asking someone who knows. “Hey Phil, where’s the best place to get
Pizza?”. Phil of course not only knows where the pizza places are, but
which one has that authentic margarita that you’ll love, the place with
the best service and which server to avoid. This kind of response is an
often seemingly just out of reach promise of search engines.
Unfortunately, computers just aren’t capable of deriving true value from
the related content.

Long ago [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com "Yahoo!") recognized what an
engineering challenge this was and launched Yahoo Directory, and later
Yahoo search… Both powered by, gasp!, humans. Unfortunately, this didn’t
scale very well. It left the door open for someone to write an
algorithmic approach that was “good enough”,
namely [Google](http://google.com "Google")‘s [Page
Rank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank "PageRank"). Page Rank
marked the last major evolution of search which unfortunately was over a
decade ago. Certainly progress has been made, but, it has been very
incremental rather than evolutionary.

The next evolution in search
----------------------------

The social web promises to assign true value to content. By it’s very
nature it will overcome the problem Yahoo encountered years ago. Web 2.0
has transitioned us from being a society of consumers to becoming
consuming producers. [Delicious.com](http://delicious.com "delicious")
is a perfect example. To use the service (consume) is to produce adding
value and a human touch to every site you bookmark and tag.

The Social Web scales infinitely. As more users consume, more produce.
It can span deeper and wider with a level of accuracy that Google could
only dream of … and it does so assigning (and creating) value along the
way.

It will be interesting to see if Google evolves into something relevant
by the time the semantic web takes hold. Looking at recent actions
(google wave) it appears they just might.
