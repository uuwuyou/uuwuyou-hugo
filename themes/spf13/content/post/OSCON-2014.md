I had the great opportunity to not only attend OSCON this year, but also be a
speaker. As always, OSCON was a conference not to be missed. In my opinion it
was the best conference of the year.

Rather than providing a play by play I wanted to talk about some of the
highlights from my perspective.

One of the things I appreciate most about OSCON is the diversity, both in the
usual sense (gender, race, etc) but also a wide diversity of interests and
backgrounds. 

It started out strong. I ran the 5k glow run with Francesk from Google,
our new friend Sarah and about 500 other people. Due to a measuring
error it was actually closer to 6k which was further than I had ran in a
long time.

The next morning I gave the first of my 3 talks, a workshop on building
your fist Go application using MongoDB. There was a lot of enthusiasm
and interest around both Go and MongoDB.
