I’m happy to announce that going forward you’ll be able to read my
articles on DZone as well as spf13.com. DZone has invited me to join
their MVB program. They describe their program as:

> DZone’s Most Valuable Blogger program brings together a group of
> highly talented bloggers, authors, and technologists actively writing
> about topics of interest to the developer community. These people are
> recognized in the industry for their contributions and deep technical
> knowledge on subjects ranging from software design and architecture to
> programming on a range of platforms including Java, .NET, Ruby and
> others.
>
> The MVB program builds mutually beneficial partnerships between DZone
> and community bloggers whose articles are of interest to the developer
> community. The program simplifies the process of publishing selected
> blog articles by MVB members onto DZone’s network of
> development-focused editorial websites. Through this process, our MVBs
> enjoy substantially increased visibility and our audience enjoys great
> content.

You can learn more about the MVB program

I want to thank the DZone team for the chance to share my knowledge,
insights and ramblings with a larger audience. If you are new to my

Lastly, please give feedback on any articles you read. I helps me to
