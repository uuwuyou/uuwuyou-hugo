Learn how to integrate MongoDB with Hadoop for large-scale distributed
data processing. Using Hadoopâ€™s MapReduce and Streaming you will learn
how to do analytics and ETL on large datasets with the ability to load
and save data against MongoDB. With support for Hadoop streaming support
goes beyond the native Java enabling map reduce to be run in languages
like Python and Ruby.
