Learn how to integrate MongoDB with Hadoop for large-scale distributed
data processing. Using tools like MapReduce, Pig and Streaming you will
learn how to do analytics and ETL on large datasets with the ability to
load and save data against MongoDB. With Hadoop MapReduce, Java and
Scala programmers will find a native solution for using MapReduce to
process their data with MongoDB. Programmers of all kinds will find a
new way to work with ETL using Pig to extract and analyze large datasets
and persist the results to MongoDB. Python and Ruby Programmers can
rejoice as well in a new way to write native Mongo MapReduce using the
Hadoop Streaming interfaces.
