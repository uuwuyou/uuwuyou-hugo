This week I joined a few of my co-workers down in LA. We met with a few
companies and ran the MongoDB LA Users Group. Notably I met with Magento
about the possibility of Magento 2.0 being built on MongoDB. On my final
night in LA I presented on MongoDB, E-commerce and Transactions.

I really enjoyed my time in LA and am looking forward to returning. I
was impressed by how many companies are using MongoDB in LA and how
great the interaction was at the Meetup.
