Last week I had the pleasure of attending MongoUK in London. I had a
great time presenting and meeting new friends. I even survived two
whiteboard sessions where people were invited to ask any question, any
at all, about MongoDB.

I gave a pretty significatly revised presentation on MongoDB and
E-Commerce with emphasis on transactions. If you saw the presentation at
MongoNYC this summer, itâ€™s worth a revisit.
