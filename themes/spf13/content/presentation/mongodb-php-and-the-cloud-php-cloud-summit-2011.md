I had the opportunity to present at the [PHP Cloud Summit
2011](http://www.phparch.com/phparchitect-live-presents-the-cloud-summit/)
among some great presenters. This was first time speaking at an online
conference. Thanks to the diligent efforts from
[Cal](http://twitter.com/calevans),
[Keith](http://twitter.com/CaseySoftware) and
[Jeremy](http://twitter.com/JeremyKendall) at PHPArch it was a really
successful experience. I actually presented with two Macbooks. One open
to IRC where questions were coming in and the other open to the
presentation. In spite of it being all online, the audience asked some
great questions and it was really fun to interact with them.

An introduction to using MongoDB with PHP.

Walking through the basics of schema design, connecting to a DB,
performing CRUD operations and queries in PHP.<br>
 MongoDB runs great in the cloud, but there are some things you should
know. In this session we’ll explore scaling and performance
characteristics of running MongoDB in the cloud as well as best practices
for running on platforms like Amazon EC2.
